1.WHAT IS ANY TYPE, AND WHEN TO USE IT? 

==> # Any is a data type in TypeScript. 
    # Any type is used when we deal with third# party programs.
    # used when we dont hv knowledge of datatype of variable & want dynamic content from source.
    # Any data type is used for type checking during compilation.
    # for e.g
            let temp: any;
            temp = "string";
            temp = 2;
            temp = true;




2. WHAT IS CLOSURE? 

==> # closure is action that is inner function can have access to the outer function variables 
    # as well as global variables.
    # closure gives u access to an outer function scope in inner function.
    # provide benefit of data hiding and data encapsulation(oops).
    # for eg.
            function outer(b) 
            {
                var a = "hello";    //a is local var created by outer function 
                function inner()  // closure function
                {
                    return a + b;  //values of a and b are accessed from outer scope/parent function. 
                }
                return inner();      //output: helloworld
            }
            console.log(outer("world"));
            
            
            

3. WHAT ARE DATATYPE IN JAVASCRIPT? 

==> # var,let,const --> same variable can be used to hold different data types.
    # boolean       -->  return true or false
    # string        -->  eg let a='hello'; let b="hello"; let c=`hello`;
    # undefined     --> return when value is not assinged to var.
    # null          -->  let a=null; then the type of a is object.
    # NaN           --> return NaN when result of arithmetic op is not an number
    for eg.
        let naMe = 'abcd';
        console.log(typeof(name1)); // returns "string"

        let number = 1;
        console.log(typeof(number)); //returns "number"

        let valueChecked = true;
        console.log(typeof(valueChecked)); //returns "boolean"

        let a = null;
        console.log(typeof(a)); // returns "object"

        let b;
        console.log(typeof(b)) //retrun undefined

        let c = [];
        console.log(typeof(c)) //return object

        let num = 10;
        let div = 0;
        console.log(div = num / "hello");  //return NaN  
        
        
        
        

4. WHAT IS VARIABLE TYPING? 

==> # JavaScript is a loosely typed language(i.e. the variables are declared without a type).
    # In JS, variable type is determined only when a value is assigned.
    # reassign data of a different type to the same variable (accidentally or on purpose),
      & the compiler will not generate an error.
    # JS automatically adjust the datatype while assigning or reassigning the variables.

    for eg:
        var x;           // Now x is undefined
        x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
        x = "hello";      // Now x is a String
        
        
        

5.What is call back function in JS? 

==> # A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
    # A callback function can run after another function has finished
    
    # for eg.
        let msg = () => {
            console.log("this msg display after 5 second");
        }
        setTimeout(msg, 5000); //msg is a callback function





6.WHAT IS SPLICE? HOW CAN I REPLACE CHARS INSIDE THE STRING? 

==>	#  The splice() method is a built# in method for JavaScript Array objects.
	#  It lets you change the content of your array by removing or replacing existing elements with 	 new ones. 
	#  This method modifies the original array and returns the removed elements as a new array.
	
	
	
7.Solve 10+20+’30’ and ‘10’+20+30? 10 + '20' + 30
 
==> 	# 10+20+'30'     // 3030
	# '10'+20+30? 10 + '20' + 30  	 //SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
	# '10'+20+30/ 10 + '20' + 30  	//102032030
